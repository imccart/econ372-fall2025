    "text": "Distributions\nA distribution in statistics describes how the values of a random variable are spread or dispersed over possible outcomes. Distributions can represent both discrete and continuous variables. For discrete variables, the probability mass function (PMF) assigns a probability to each possible outcome. For continuous variables, the probability density function (PDF) represents how likely a random variable is to take a value within a certain range. The PDF doesn’t give probabilities directly but rather describes the density of probabilities over an interval; the area under the curve of a PDF between two points gives the probability that the variable falls within that range.\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) is another important concept related to distributions. It gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. For continuous variables, the CDF is the integral of the PDF, and it ranges from 0 to 1 as the variable progresses from its minimum to maximum possible values. The CDF provides a way to understand the cumulative probability up to a given point and is useful for comparing probabilities across different intervals of a distribution. Both PDFs and CDFs are essential in understanding and analyzing the behavior of random variables in probability and statistics.\nWhile we won’t work much with any distributions directly, the concept of distributions will arise when we discuss physician learning. We will make several simplyfying assumptions to avoid doing much mathematical work with these distributions; however, it might be useful to understand key terms such as a “binomial”, “Bernoulli”, and the “Beta” distributions.",

    "section": "Bayes Theorem",
    "text": "Bayes Theorem\nBayes’ Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. It relates the conditional probability of an event, given prior knowledge, to the likelihood of that event happening. In simple terms, Bayes’ Theorem helps us revise the probability of an event (such as having a disease) based on the accuracy of a test and the prior probability of the event occurring in the population. This theorem is particularly useful in fields like medical diagnostics, decision-making, and machine learning.\nFor two events, A and B, Bayes’ Theorem formula is as follows:\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\nAs an example, suppose 1% of a population has a rare disease. A diagnostic test for this disease is 90% accurate, meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of people with the disease (true positive) and 90% of people without the disease (true negative). If a person tests positive, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\nWhere: - \\(P(A)\\) is the probability of having the disease (prior probability). - \\(P(B|A)\\) is the probability of testing positive given that the person has the disease (test sensitivity). - \\(P(B|\\neg A)\\) is the probability of testing positive given that the person does not have the disease (false positive rate). - \\(P(B)\\) is the total probability of testing positive, regardless of the actual disease status.\nWe are looking to calculate \\(P(A|B)\\), which is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\n# Define the known probabilities\nP_A &lt;- 0.01    # Probability of having the disease\nP_not_A &lt;- 1 - P_A   # Probability of not having the disease\nP_B_given_A &lt;- 0.90  # Probability of testing positive given disease\nP_B_given_not_A &lt;- 0.10  # Probability of testing positive without disease\n\n# Calculate the total probability of testing positive (P(B))\nP_B &lt;- (P_B_given_A * P_A) + (P_B_given_not_A * P_not_A)\n\n# Apply Bayes' Theorem to find P(A|B) - Probability of having the disease given a positive test\nP_A_given_B &lt;- (P_B_given_A * P_A) / P_B\n\n# Display the result\nP_A_given_B\n\n[1] 0.08333333\n\n\nEven though the test is 90% accurate, the probability of actually having the disease given a positive test result is only about 8.3%. This is because the disease is rare, affecting only 1% of the population.\nThus, it’s essential to consider both the accuracy of the test and the prevalence of the disease when interpreting diagnostic test results.",

You may find it very useful to additionally have sources from news organizations, government websites or publications, official reports, and think tanks. The trick here is to really evaluate the quality and impartiality of the source. Look up the background of think tanks and organizations on Wikipedia or other sources and be clear about how the quality of the source shapes the arguments made in the brief.\nYour sources should be carefully selected to contribute different pieces to the puzzle. Make sure you have sources about background/context, other sources more on evaluating policy, perhaps some news stories about recent events. You want your brief to be well-rounded and not missing any big gaps in pertinent information. You may not end up using all the sources in your fact sheet and policy brief, but the more sources you identify now, the easier it will be to refine your points. You may also find that as you’re working on your project, you will need to find new sources. Additionally, sources do not have to be on the exact same topic, but they should relate.

Assume also that patients receive some total benefit from care received, reflected by the equation \\(B(x)=20x - (1/2)x^{2}\\).

    "text": "Empirical Questions\n\nIn January 2014, CMS reduced it’s payments to physicians for epidural steroidal injections (CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318, and 62319). The reduction was part of an effort to adjust “potentially misvalued services,” in which CMS lowered the payment rates back to 2013 levels. CMS subsequently increased the payment levels in 2015. Talk about whiplash! For this question, we’re going to use the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from 2013 through 2015 to see how these payment changes may have affected the frequency of epidural steroidal injections. These data are available on our OneDrive folder for homework 2, the link to which is on Canvas. The data are available as an R data set, hwk2_data_q4.Rdata, or as a tab-delimited text file hwk2_data_q4.txt. Take a look at the data in your favorite software, and answer the following questions:\n\nHow many unique physicians administered at least one epidural steroidal injection in 2013?\nAmong those physicians, what was the average number of injections in each year (2013 through 2015)? Use a graph to support your answer.\nAmong physicians with some injections in both 2013 and 2014, identify the physicians with the 10 largest reductions in injections from 2013 to 2014 (i.e., I want to see the physicians with the largest reductions, but exclude physicians that dropped to 0).\nFor the physicians identified in part 3, plot the number of injections for each physician over time (scatter plot with the count of injections on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nFor part 3, consider the following strategies:\n\nPivot table\n\nhlookup/vlookup in Excel, pivot_wider in R\n\nCreate individual 2013 and 2014 datasets, and join the data\n\nhlookup in Excel, inner_join in R\n\nCreate new variable (2014 count - 2013 count)\nTake smallest 10 values (largest negatives)\n\nhlookup/vlookup in Excel\nslice in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, CMS changed its physician fee schedule, instituting relatively large increases for “Evaluation and Management” (E&M, or just office visits) codes. But, due to budget neutrality requirements, such an increase required an offset for other services. Therefore, CMS also lowered the overall “conversion factor”. This made more expensive services in 2020 relatively less profitable, while payments for otherwise less expensive services were less affected (E&M services, of course, actually increased in payment rate). For this question, we’re going to again work with the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data (hwk2_data_q5.Rdata as an R data set or hwk2_data_q5.txt as a tab-delimited text file). We’ll focus only on physicians in Georgia because the full data is a little too much to manage for this assignment. Please be sure to take a look at the primer, available here, for more details about the policy and payment changes. Then answer the following questions:\n\nIdentify a set of HCPCS codes that capture physician office visits. Do some internet digging first, just to see if you can find the codes that way. Ultimately, the best strategy is probably to identify the relevant codes based on the observed descriptions in the data.\nIdentify the physicians with the most (top 10) E&M visits in 2020.\nHow much would these physicians from part B (the top 10 physicians) stand to gain from the increased RVU rate? Show your results in a table. You can see the percentage increases from the CMS Final Rule Discussion document available here.\nIn the context of physician agency, what might you predict will happen to utilization of more expensive services after the 2021 fee schedule update?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nFor part 3, consider the following:\n\nCalculate total payments (avg_payment*count)\nApply % increase from 2020 to 2021 to find new payment",

    "text": "Math Problems\n\nQuestion 1\nAssume your utility function is \\(u(w)=\\sqrt{w}\\), and you begin with wealth of \\(w=\\) $100. I propose a lottery in which I flip a coin. If the coin turns up heads, you win $30. If the coin turns up tails, you lose $30. \n\nWhat’s the expected monetary value of this lottery?\nWhat is your utility at this expected value?\nWhat’s the expected utility from this lottery?\nIn one sentence, explain why your answer in part (c) differs from part (b).\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nExpected wealth is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\times 70 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 130 = 100\\).\nAt the wealth value of $100, \\(u(100)=\\sqrt{100}=10\\).\nExpected utility is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{70} + \\frac{1}{2}\\times \\sqrt{130} = 9.88.\\)\nIf you choose this lottery, you are entering into a risky scenario, and so your expected utility is lower than if you were to receive the same expected monetary value of the lottery ($100) with certainty.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nConsider the utility function, \\(u(w)=\\ln(w)\\). Assume an individual starts with wealth of $50,000. With probability 0.6, this person will get sick and incur a cost of $10,000.\n\nWhat is the expected utility and expected wealth in this situation?\nWhat is the risk premium?\nWhat is the maximum amount this person is willing to pay for health insurance?\nWhat happens to the risk premium if the probability of illness decreases by 0.05? Explain in one sentence.\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nExpected utility is \\(E[u(w)]=0.6 \\times \\ln (40000) + 0.4 \\times \\ln (50000) = 10.686\\) and expected wealth is \\(E[w]=0.6 \\times 40000 + 0.4 \\times 50000 = 44,000\\).\nThe monetary value that provides a level of utility equal to expected utility in this case is \\(u^{-1}\\left(E[u(w)]\\right) = u^{-1}(10.686) = e^{10.686} \\approx 43,740.\\) The risk premium is then \\(\\pi = 44000-43740=260\\).\nThis is just the risk premium ($260) plus the expected cost of care ($6,000). So they are willing to pay up to $6,260 for health insurance (i.e., this is the price at which they would be indifferent between purchasing or not purchasing health insurance).\nIn this case, a decrease in the probability of illness will increase the uncertainty since we’re starting at a probability of 0.6. So this would lead to an increase in the risk premium and a decrease in the maximum willingness to pay for health insurance.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nAssume an insurer’s cost function is given by \\(C=100q - 2q^{2}\\), where \\(q\\) denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that demand is given by \\(D=120-3q\\). The total size of the population is \\(N=40\\).\n\nWhat is the equilibrium price if the insurer earns $0 profit?\nAt this equilibrium price, how many people in this market are uninsured?\nThe government is considering providing a fixed dollar subsidy per person. Find the smallest possible subsidy such that all individuals purchase health insurance.\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nThe equilibrium price will be at the point were \\(p=D=AC\\). In this case, \\(AC=\\frac{100q - 2q^{2}}{q} = 100-2q.\\) Setting this equal to demand, \\(120-3q = 100-2q\\), so \\(q=20\\). Plugging this back into the demand function shows that \\(q=20\\) will occur at a \\(p=120-3q=120-3\\times 20=60\\).\nWe know that the equilibrium quantity is \\(q=20\\), and that the total number of people in the market is \\(N=40\\). So 20 individuals remain uninsured.\nThe key here is to start with the graph and recognize what a fixed dollar subsidy per person amounts to just a shift in the demand curve (i.e., a change in the intercept and not a change in the slope). If we are trying to have everyone insured, then this fixed subsidy must be such that the demand curve intersects with the AC curve only at \\(N=40\\). At \\(q=40\\), we know that \\(AC=100-2q=20\\). So we need to provide a subsidy such that quantity demanded is 40 and a price of $20. Turning back to the demand curve, and denoting the subsidy by \\(s\\), we need to find \\(s\\) such that \\(20=120+s-3\\times 40\\) (this tells us \\(s\\) to satisfy \\(D=40\\) at \\(p=20\\)). This means that \\(s=20\\), so we need to give everyone a $20 subsidy to buy health insurance if we want everyone in this market to be insured.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nConsider a physician or physician practice that sets quantity of care, \\(x\\), and price, \\(p\\), to maximize profits subject to providing at least enough net benefit to meet a patient’s best outside option. Assume that the patient receives benefit from care according to the benefit function, \\(B(x)=20x-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\). Further assume that \\(NB^{0}=36\\) and \\(c=2\\), and that the patient pays the full price of care.\n\nFind the physician’s optimal \\(x\\) and \\(p\\).\nFind the patient’s optimal level of care, \\(x\\).\nWhat happens to the amount of overtreatment if \\(NB^{0}\\) decreases from 36 to 18 (i.e., the patient has a less viable outside option)?\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nThe physician’s problem is to maximize \\(px - cx\\) subject to the constraint that \\(B(x)-px=NB^{0}\\). Rewriting the constraint as \\(px=B(x)-NB^{0}\\), we can first find the physician’s optimal choice of \\(x\\) as that which maximizes \\(B(x)-NB^{0}-cx = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 36 - 2x\\). Taking the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and setting equal to 0 yields, \\(20-x-2=0\\), or \\(x^{*}=18\\). We can then find the price by substituting this level of \\(x\\) into the constraint, so that \\(p=\\frac{1}{x} \\times \\left( B(x) - NB^{0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x} \\times \\left(20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 36 \\right) = 20-9-2=9\\). So the physician sets \\(p^{*}=9\\) and \\(x^{*}=18\\).\nThe patient simply wants to maximize their net benefit, \\(B(x)-px=20x-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}-px\\). Again taking the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and setting equal to 0 yields \\(20-x-p=0\\) or \\(x=20-p\\). At \\(p^{*}=9\\), the patient’s optimal level of care is then \\(\\bar{x}=11\\).\nA decrease in \\(NB^{0}\\) doesn’t change the physician’s first order conditions, and so the physician’s optimal level of care is the same at \\(x^{*}=18\\). But the price now changes because the physician can increase price and still maintain a net benefit equal to the patient’s best outside option. Specifically, the price now increases to \\(p=20-\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{18}{x} = 10\\). At this price, the patient’s optimal level of care is \\(\\bar{x}=20-p=10\\). So the amount of overtreatment increased, from 7 units of care to 8.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nAssume that the physician instead faces an administratively set price of \\(\\bar{p}\\) and that the best outside option is \\(NB^{0}=0\\). Maintain the assumption that \\(B(x)=20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\).\n\nFind the physician’s optimal quantity of care as a function of \\(\\bar{p}\\).\nHow does the physician’s choice of \\(x\\) change with \\(\\bar{p}\\)? If we think of physician services as just a supply curve, is the direction of this relationship surprising or as expected?\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nIn this case, the physician simply sets \\(x\\) as high as possible (assuming \\(\\bar{p}&gt;c\\)). The only thing restricting the physician from increasing \\(x\\) is the constraint on net benefit, so to find \\(x\\) we just rewrite the net benefit constraint \\(\\bar{p}x = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - NB^{0} = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}.\\) We can rewrite this further such that \\(\\bar{p} = \\frac{1}{x}\\times \\left(20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} \\right) = 20-\\frac{1}{2}x\\). Finally, solving for \\(x\\) instead of \\(\\bar{p}\\), yields \\(x^{*} = 2 (20-\\bar{p})\\).\nAn increase in \\(\\bar{p}\\) will lead to a decrease in \\(x^{*}\\), which is surprising compared to a traditional supply curve but not surprising in the context of this model where physicians set the choice of care. Note that this result only applies because we assume that patients pay \\(\\bar{p}\\) for each unit of care received. If physicians received a higher price and the patient’s out of pocket costs were unchanged, then this would lead to no change in the quantity of care and higher profits for the physician. Essentially, the physician is only restricted by the patient’s net benefit, so if the price to the patient increases, the physician must provide less care otherwise the patient would leave the practice and take their outside option.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nAssume a physician is operating with the profit function, \\[\\pi = NB \\left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \\right],\\] where \\(NB=B(x) - p_{d}x\\), \\(p_{s}\\) denotes the (fixed) price paid by the insurer to the physician, \\(p_{d}\\) denotes the (fixed) price paid by the patient, \\(R\\) denotes the capitated payment per patient, \\(NB\\) denotes the net benefit to the patient, and \\(x\\) denotes the quantity of care per patient.\n\nAssuming \\(B(x) = 5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\), \\(p_{d}=0\\), \\(p_{s}-c=1\\), and \\(R=2\\), find the physician’s optimal level of \\(x\\).\nCompare the amount in part (a) with the patient’s optimal. Is this a scenario of overtreatment or undertreatment?\nAssume instead that the government sets \\(R=3\\). Does this increase or decrease the amount of overtreatment? Show your answer.\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nIn this setup, the profit function is \\(\\pi = (5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2})(2+x)\\). Differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) yields \\((5 - x)(2 + x) + (5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2})\\). Expanding the first term, we get \\[10 + 5x - 2x - x^{2} + 5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}=0.\\] Rearranging and combining terms then gives us \\(-\\frac{3}{2}x^{2} + 8x + 10=0\\). We can solve this using the quadratic formula, \\(x=\\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 4 (3/2) (10)}}{-3} \\approx \\left( \\frac{8-11.1}{3}, \\frac{8+11.1}{3}\\right)\\). The positive solution is approximately \\(x^{*} \\approx 6.4\\).\nThe patient wants to maximize their net benefit, which in this case is \\(B'(x)=0\\), or \\(5 - x = 0\\). So the patient would choose \\(\\bar{x}=5\\). The physician’s choice of \\(x^{*}\\approx 6.4\\) therefore represents overtreatment.\nAt \\(R=3\\), the first order condition becomes \\(-\\frac{3}{2}x^{2} + 7x + 15 = 0\\). We can again solve this using the quadratic formula, \\(x=\\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 4 (3/2) (15)}}{-3} \\approx \\left( \\frac{7-11.8}{3}, \\frac{7+11.8}{3}\\right)\\). The positive solution is approximately \\(x^{*} \\approx 6.3\\). Overtreatment has therefore decreased, which should be the case as we shift the incentive more toward the capitated payment and away from the fee-for-service payment.",

For example, a firm’s total revenue (TR) is a function of the amount they produce (Q), such that: \\[TR = TR(Q).\\] This means that total revenue depends on \\(Q\\), the quantity of product produced and sold. Total cost is also a function of \\(Q\\): \\[TC = TC(Q).\\]\nAs a more explicit example, suppose that the inverse demand for a firm is \\[P = 100 - 0.10Q,\\] where \\(P\\) denotes price and \\(Q\\) denotes quantity. Since total revenue is the product of price and quantity, we have \\[TR = P \\times Q = (100 - 0.10Q) \\times Q = 100Q - 0.10Q^2.\\] Thus, total revenue is a function of quantity produced and sold.\nSome functions are more complicated. Producing health care, for example, requires a hospital or some facility (\\(x_{1}\\)); lots of equipment and medical supplies (\\(x_{2}\\)); and physicians, nurses, and staff (\\(x_{3}\\)).

These rules are mechanical, but they are useful to remember and only require some basic alebra.\n\nThe derivative of a constant is 0\nThe power rule\n\nConsider the function, \\(y=f(x)=x^{n}\\). The derivative of \\(y\\) is \\(f'(x) = n x^{n-1}\\). For example:\n\nIf \\(y=x^{3}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 3x^{2}\\).\nIf \\(y=x^{-2}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = -2x^{-3}\\).\nIf \\(y=x\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = x^{0} = 1\\).\n\n\nConstant multiples\n\nLet \\(k\\) be any constant. Then if \\(y=k x^{n}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = n k x^{n-1}\\). For example:\n\nIf \\(y=2x^{4}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 8x^{3}\\).\nIf \\(y=-2x\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = -2\\)\n\n\nThe sum and difference rule\n\nLet \\(y=f(x) + g(x)\\). Then the derivative of \\(y\\) is just the sum of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). Similarly, the derivative of \\(y=f(x) - g(x)\\) is the difference of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). We just differentiate one term at a time.\n\nProduct rule\n\nIf \\(y=f(x) \\times g(x)\\), then ther derivative is \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = f(x) \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x} + g(x) \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} f(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}.\\] In words, this is “the derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first.

For example, revenue is a function of \\(Q\\), which in turn may be a function of production inputs. Suppose that our short-run production function is \\(Q=Q(L)\\), where \\(L\\) is quantity of labor. The firm faces an inverse demand function, \\(P=P(Q)\\), such that revenue is \\[TR = P(Q) \\times Q(L).\\] So revenue is a function of \\(Q\\), which is itself a function of \\(L\\).\nTo find the derivative with respect to \\(L\\), we differentiate \\(P(Q) \\times Q\\) using the product rule, and then multiply the result by the derivative of \\(Q\\) with respect to \\(L\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} TR}{\\mathrm{d} L} = \\left(P(Q) + Q \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} P(Q)}{\\mathrm{d} Q} \\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d} Q}{\\mathrm{d} L}.\\]",

This is because the consumer only pays a fraction of the price, and thus is less sensitive to the price. This allows the firm to increase the price. However, consumers remain responsible for some portion of price increases, unlike the case of copayments where consumers are shielded from price increases beyond the copayment amount. Not surprisingly, we see insurers opting for coinsurance over copayments when covering high cost brand name drugs.",

In this case, we have two possible outcomes: a) healthy, which gives us a wealth of $100,000; or b) sick, in which case we incur the cost of illness and end up with $60,000. So to find the expected utility, we need to find the utility associated with each possible wealth value, and then we need to take the expectation over those utility values:\nStep 1: Find utility values:\n\nIf healthy: \\(u(w)|_{w=100,000} = 100,000^{0.2}=\\) 10\nIf sick: \\(u(w)|_{w=60,000} = 60,000^{0.2}=\\) 9.0288\n\nStep 2: Take the expectation Taking the expectation over these utility values yields: \\(E[u]=0.7 \\times\\) 10 \\(+0.3 \\times\\) 9.0288 \\(=\\) 9.7086.",

We just need to calculate the utility at this expected monetary value, \\(u=(88,000)^{0.2}=\\) 9.7476.

For each segment, we will examine underlying theoretical model(s), consider empirical evidence in the area, and discuss relevant health care policy. My specific goals are that, by the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the structure of the U.S. health care system, its main components, and its history;\nModel adverse selection in health insurance, examine its effects on health insurance markets, and support your arguments with existing data;\nExplain the physician agency problem, use a model of physician agency to examine financial incentives in health care, and summarize empirical evidence on the presence of physician agency;\nDescribe hospital pricing, negotiation with insurers, and explain (qualitatively and quantitatively) the differences between charges and prices;\nSummarize key elements of prescription drug markets, including the role of patents, generic drugs, and the FDA; and\nAnalyze hospital data in a real-life setting and discuss the likely effects of real-life policies."

Hopefully it’s clear by the existence of the site that this is where I plan to host most of our course materials such as notes/slides, assignments, practice problems, etc. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if needed) and grades.\n\n\nReadings\nThere are a few optional textbooks for this class. One is an intermediate microeconomics textbook that will cover much of the basic economic theory, another is an older health economics textbook that was pretty good at the time but is no longer updated, and the last is a newer book that is an easy read but not necessarily very formal. These books are in now way required, but they may be helpful for some students as an additional resource.\n\nPindyck and Rubinfeld (2018)\nSloan and Hsieh (2012)\nFriedson (2023)\n\nWe will supplement these textbooks with other readings as well as online presentations, policy papers, and videos. I’m also writing an online book specifically for this class (still very much a work in progress). A comprehensive list of materials and potential readings are available from the schedule page.\n\n\nStatistics software\nEach homework assignment will generally include both a theoretical and empirical section. Most of the empirical work involves basic summary statistics. This can be done in just about any spreadsheet or statistics package. I’ll use R for my work, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with. I encourage you to use R or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in applied data analysis right now, but you can certainly use Excel or Google Sheets if you’d prefer. This is not a statistics or econometrics class, so I do not expect you to have any statistics programming knowledge. A few instructional videos are also available on Canvas to help with specific programming issues or Excel steps.\n\n\nAccessing data\nFor all homework assignments, I will house all of the links to the data on our class website, and I’ll place the relevant datasets in a shared OneDrive folder as needed. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R. But please note, knowledge of Git or GitHub is not expected or required for this class."

Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\n\nClass meetings\nAll regular class meetings will take place in White Hall, Room 103 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:30am (what!? I know right) to 9:45am.\n\n\nOffice hours\nMy designated office hours will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:00am to 11:00am in the R. Randall Rollins Building, Room 418. This is the 4th floor of the new Rollins School building. My office hours are in-person, as I want to encourage everyone to come visit face-to-face if at all possible. I’m also available outside of the 10-11am times, but those times are less predictable. In general, even if you’re planning to visit during normal office hours, please schedule an appointment here. This just ensures that everyone has the proper time for a meeting.\nIf you need to meet virtually, I’ve posted a virtual meeting link on our Canvas page. Please indicate the virtual meeting when you schedule online so that I know where we’re meeting!\nWhile we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\n\n\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\n\n\nTeaching Assistants\nWe have an excellent economics PhD student as our teaching assistant this year. They will be available to help with any questions you have about the material, assignments, or anything else. They will also be grading your assignments. Please be nice. They are here to help you.\n\nKaterina Katsimpri: Office hours TBD. Email, aikaterini.christina.katsimpri@emory.edu.\n\n\n\nTurning things in\nAll homework assignments should be submitted as PDF files on Canvas via GradeScope. Since we’ll be using some math in all of our answers, you may consider (thought it’s definitely not required) creating your homework answers in Overleaf. As an Emory student, everyone has access to an institutional Overleaf account, which provides you with all the nice features of the product. You can use this to easily write PDF documents in a language known as “LaTeX”. For a brief introductory video and links to more info, please see the video here. Again, Overleaf is not a requirement, but I think it could save you some time in the long run. You are also welcome to use Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc., and convert to PDF for your final submission.\nThe only requirements are that your submission is a PDF and that your answers are legible and organized. Please DO NOT write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. We will not grade these types of submissions, and the assignment will be considered late until a legible submission is available. When you submit through GradeScope, you should be prompted to highlight which part of your PDF corresponds to each question. Please do this carefully. Misaligned submissions will be treated as late until they are properly aligned.\nYour projects should be submited within Canvas as stand-alone PDF or Word documents. Once you’ve formed your groups, only one group member should need to submit the assignment, so please communicate with each other as to who will take that responsibility. All submissions for the project will employ plagiarism-detection software, including Turnitin. Turnitin compares submitted work to sources available on the internet, archived databases of essays, journals, books, and other publications, and its database of assignments submitted in the past at Emory and other universities. Work that generates concerns about originality or citation methods will be reviewed and submitted to the Honor Council as appropriate. This software does not substitute for the judgment of the instructor and other authorities in the detection of plagiarism, and other methods may be employed in this course to determine that all work abides by the standards set forth in the Honor Code.\nAll other participation assignments will be submitted through Canvas, with details available on the Canvas assignment.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Emory University Honor Code is taken seriously and governs all work in this course. Details about the Honor Code are available here. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the teacher is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council.\n\n\nAI and Assignments\nIn this course, students are encouraged to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and related AI software for academic exploration and assistance. However, it is essential to uphold the principles of academic integrity. While you are free to seek guidance from ChatGPT, Gemini, etc., the final submissions of all assignments and assessments must reflect your individual understanding and expression. Any instance of verbatim or substantially unaltered content from ChatGPT or other external sources (including your own classmates) will be considered plagiarism and subject to our policies on academic integrity (see above). The goal is to foster critical thinking and creativity while utilizing these new tools responsibly. If you have any questions about the appropriate use of ChatGPT or related software, please ask me.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nClass-wide announcements\nI will post regular announcements to the class on Canvas, so please set up your notifications accordingly. I will also use Canvas to post all grades and any other information that needs to stay in the class. All other course materials will be available on our class website, econ372f25.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360)."
